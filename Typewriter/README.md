All the code is my own apart from the typed.js file. This was made by a chap called Matt Boldt so all credit is due to him for that
framework.

The HTML and typing.js files are my own code and only really to be used as a guide line, you can change the timing's in the JS function
and also the text that gets printed out. A CSS file is included which only has basic styling.

Any questions please feel free to drop me an email that is provided.
